 - what is rt?
 - how do I flash binary without gdb
 - how to I generate a square wave at a given frequency
   - is there a crate?
   - what is the math?
     - toggle at 1 / ( 2 * freq)
     - 1 / (2 * 2600) = 192ms
   - seems like there is a 2 DAC for triangle wave generation
 - how do I generate 2 waves at the same time?
